            The task was very daunting as the project was initially launched without an oversight.
            I had to quickly gather knowledge and start organizing cooperation between departments to
            meet stakeholders' expectations. I discovered several major risks not taken into account,
            threatening project success and managed to resolve them on a tight schedule. My contribution
            helped company resolve several bottlenecks and was greeted with success.
